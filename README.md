# HOW TO USE

1. Download [mapless practice](https://github.com/woofdoggo/mapless-practice/releases/latest).
2. Download [the macro](https://github.com/wurgo/mapless/releases/latest).
3. Download [Atum](https://github.com/VoidXWalker/Atum/releases/latest).
4. Open Minecraft, and leave it on the screen that opens when you start the game.
5. Run the macro.
6. Run the mapless practice exe.
7. Copy a seed and it should create a world *(double click a seed then press ctrl + c)*.

To play a new seed, open the pause menu, alt-tab to the mapless practice terminal and copy a new seed. This will automatically reset and apply the new seed.

If it doesn't reset correctly, try editing the number after `Sleep` (line 30 in mapless.ahk). The number should be higher for a low end PC and lower for a high end PC. **1000 = 1 second**.
